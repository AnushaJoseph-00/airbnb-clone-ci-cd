# Airbnb Clone : CI/CD Pipeline on AWS

A full-stack Airbnb clone deployed end-to-end using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on AWS. This project focuses on **DevOps implementation** - containerisation, infrastructure provisioning, secrets management, and continuous delivery.

> Built on top of the original application by [Sudeep Mahato](https://github.com/sudeepmahato16/airbnb-clone). All DevOps architecture and pipeline work by [Anusha Joseph](https://github.com/AnushaJoseph-00).

## Pipeline Overview

```
GitHub → Jenkins → SonarQube → Docker → Amazon ECR → ECS Fargate → ALB
```

Code is pushed to GitHub, triggering a Jenkins webhook. Jenkins runs the build and dispatches a static analysis scan to SonarQube. On quality gate pass, Jenkins builds and tags a Docker image, pushes it to Amazon ECR, and deploys an updated ECS Fargate task behind an Application Load Balancer. Secrets are injected at runtime via SSM Parameter Store - no credentials in the image or repository.

## DevOps Stack

| Layer | Tool / Service | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| CI/CD Orchestration | Jenkins (on EC2) | Pipeline trigger, build, deploy |
| Code Quality | SonarQube (on EC2) | Static analysis, quality gate |
| Containerisation | Docker | Image build and packaging |
| Container Registry | Amazon ECR | Private image storage |
| Container Hosting | AWS ECS Fargate | Serverless task execution |
| Load Balancing | AWS ALB | HTTPS routing, health checks |
| Secrets Management | ECS Task Definition env vars | Runtime environment injection |
| Networking | AWS VPC, Security Groups | Traffic isolation and control |

---

## Application Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 + TypeScript |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas + Prisma ORM |
| Authentication | NextAuth (Google + GitHub OAuth) |
| Image Storage | EdgeStore |
| Maps | Leaflet |

## AWS Services Used

- **EC2** - hosts Jenkins and SonarQube on a single instance
- **ECR** - private Docker image registry, tagged per build
- **ECS Fargate** - serverless container runtime, no EC2 management
- **ALB** - application load balancer with health-check routing
- **VPC / Security Groups** - network segmentation and access control

## Environment Variables

In production, environment variables are configured directly in the ECS task definition via the AWS console - set when creating the task definition or updating the ECS service. They are injected into the running container at startup and never stored in the image or the repository.

For local development, create a `.env` file at the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=
EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY=
EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY=
```

> Never commit `.env` to source control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

## Key DevOps Challenges Solved

**Docker disk exhaustion** — added a `docker system prune` step to the Jenkinsfile to prevent image accumulation filling the EC2 root volume.

**ECS 502/504 errors** — diagnosed ALB target group health check failures caused by incorrect container port mapping in the task definition; corrected port bindings restored healthy routing.

## How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnushaJoseph-00/airbnb-clone-ci-cd.git
cd airbnb-clone-ci-cd
cp .env.example .env       # fill in your values
npm install
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```
